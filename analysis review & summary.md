# Distribution & Outlier Evaluation

## Numerical Features

### loan_amt
*  All outliers are almost on upper whisker
*  Kurtosis of almost 0 signify no outliers
*  Therefore, outliers can be assumed to be not present.
*  The distribution is moderately right skewed with 0.7 as skewness, suggesting customers prefer smaller loans.

### int_rate
* Interest rates are usually in range of 10.5 to 16.5%
* Kurtosis is -0.14%, signifying absence of outliers.
* All outliers are nearby upper whisker and total outliers are 0.95%
* Overall, outliers can be assumed to be not present.
* The distribution is about symmetrical with a skewness of 0.42, might be influenced by outliers.

### Installment
* Skewness of 0.98 confirms right skewness, so most of the installments are on the lower side.
* Kurtosis of 0.78, signifies absence of large outliers in distribution.
* All outliers are concentrated in a range above upper whisker and total outliers are 2.84%
* Overall, outliers can be assumed to be not present.
* Max installment is 1533.81, so installments are of lower values.

### annual_inc
* Percent Outliers in annual_inc is 4.22%
* Annual incomes exist in the range of 0.0 to 8706582.0. It is a huge range, and outliers are distributed sparsely at extreme points. Also, Kurtosis of 4238.55 confirms a wide range.
* Incomes are heavily right skewed, skewness is 41.04
* This feature requires binning.

### dti
* Q3 is 22.98, and max value is 9999.0. It is an extreme range.
* There are only two points above 100. These 2 points are definite outliers.
* Only 0.07% records are outliers (275 rows). As total rows are 396030, we can skim this feature.
* Skewness of 431.05 and Kurtosis of 237923.67, are extremely large, after rechecking after outlier, statistics will be re-evaluated and decision on feature binning will be confirmed.
* Since only 275 records were outliers, they were capped at whisker points. 

### open_acc
* Open Account has Q3: 14.0 (IQR: 6.0) and max value of 90.0. There is an extreme range in this feature.

* Percent Outliers in pub_rec: 14.58%
* This is a clear case for feature binning, as this feature represents exceptional cases - negative public records

### revol_bal
* Q1: 6025.0, Q3: 19620.0, Max: 1743266.0 - distribution is in a large range.
* Percent Outliers in revol_bal: 5.37%
* This feature will require feature binning or alternate transformation

### revol_util
* Total Outliers in revol_util: 12, Percent Outliers in revol_util: ~0.00%
* There is 1 extreme outlier that will require removal, otherwise all data points are below 200
* All other outlier points are near the upper whisker
* Skewness: -0.07188910791723081, Kurtosis: 2.716256667706004 suggest that distribution is not skewed and there are not a lot of outliers.

### total_acc 
* total_acc is in a wide range, Q1: 17.0, Q3: 32.0, Max: 151.0.
* All outlier points are concentrated uniformly around the whisker.
* Skewness: 0.86,suggests right skewness.
* Total Outliers in total_acc: 8499, Percent Outliers in total_acc: 2.15%.
* Kurtosis: 1.20 suggests that the feature is more uniformly distributed across a wide range.
* Overall, we can assume that outliers are not present, few extreme points
* We may consider binning this feature as range 

### mort_acc
* Total Outliers in mort_acc: 6843, Percent Outliers in mort_acc: 1.73%
Q1: 0.0, Q3: 3.0, Max: 34.0 suggest outliers 
Kurtosis: 5.30, suggests and percent outliers are prominent in this feature. 
Skewness: 1.7558645341907244
We will perform feature binning for this feature

### pub_rec_bankruptcies
* Q1: 0.0, Q3: 0.0, IQR: 0.0 suggests this feature covers exceptional cases
* Min: 0.0, Max: 8.0, Median: 0.0, feature has a short range
* This feature must be feature binned

### Earliest_cr_year
* This feature has a wide range of years

### Earliest_cr_month
* Each month is contributing to 7% to 10%. 


# Analysis
* Among imbalance treatments, adjusting class weights was identified to be best. It is simpler approach providing best results. With SMOTE we observed that train set was slightly underperforming and test was better. This is due to imbalance treatment done on train set, so test set became easier for the model.
* 94% precision obtained on Test set. Results on train set were slightly lower, as smote was applied on train set, so Test set is performing better.
* Model is performing with 94.3% accuracy.
* We achieved a good ROC
* Overall coefficients, suggest Pin Code is highly significant.
